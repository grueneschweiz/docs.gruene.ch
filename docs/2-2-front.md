title: Edit front page

## Precondition

Make sure you're [logged in](2-1-login.md).


## How to get to the edit screen

There are mainly two ways:
1. Go to the front page (on the [frontend](1-2-terms.md#frontend)) and click 
the _edit page_ button.

1. Go to pages, hover the mouse pointer over the front page and click the 
edit link.

## You'll master it

The front page is the most advanced page to edit. Once you master it, editing 
other pages is peanuts 😁. And even the front page isn't that complicated!


## The main campaign

This is the main content block with the images the bars etc.

Just play around with the main campaign elements in the 
[edit mode](#how-to-get-to-the-edit-screen) of the front page and you'll find
out how it works.

The main idea of the **campaign summary** is, to provide the reader with your 
main mission in very few words. If you need more space, you can create a 
dedicated page and link it to the campaign summary using the _Read more 
button_. For now, just keep it short. Once you know more about pages, adding
the link is intuitive.

The **call to action** section is designed to easily involve your visitors. 
Add a form with a very low level involvement, like to subscribe to your 
newsletter. To add forms, see the [forms chapter](x-x-forms.md).


## The content blocks

All other content on the front page, is to be added and edited in the _Content
Blocks_ section. Content blocks can be positioned in any order and you are 
free to add any type of block.

Every content block has a _Block Title_. The Block title refers to this:

You can link the block title to an [archive](1-2-terms.md#archives) 
(category), any page, post or event on this website (internal), an external URL
or simply don't link it at all (none).


### Positions

Use the positions block to present your political views to the visitors with 
a few keywords. If you want to tell more about it, you are free to create a 
page for every position block and add it as read more target.

### Events

The events block displays your upcoming events. To add events, see the 
[events chapter](x-x-events.md).

### Testimonials

Present your supporters using a testimonials block. You must add the 
testimonials in the [people section](x-x-people.md) first.

### Single Post / Page Teaser

If you want to feature a special page or post on your front page, use this 
block. It can be added multiple times.

### Double Post / Page Teaser

This works analogous to the 
[Single Post / Page Teaser](#single-post--page-teaser) but shows two teasers 
at once.

### Latest Press Release

This block is especially designed for party websites. You can configure 
this block, to always display the newest [post](x-x-post.md) of a 
certain category. If the given post contains a quote, the quote will be 
displayed instead of the lead.

### Vote Recommendations

This block is especially designed for party websites. Place it close to the top.
The main goal is, to provide all your vote recommendations at single a glance.
You should link either a post where you explain your position in detail, or a
link to an external source, like a committee, where a votes can gather more 
information.

### Map Block

This is advanced. If you know enough to use it, you most probably don't need
this manual 😉.
